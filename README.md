# Bitcoin_Prediction using LSTM
Bitcoin  Price Prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning<br>
1.Data Collection
<p>Loading Dataset from Yahoo Finance<p>
2.Data Preprocessing
  <p>Clean and prepare the data. 
   This includes handling missing values,
  outliers and converting data into suitable format 
   for analysis<p>
3.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)<br>
<p>Conduct exploratory analysis to understand <br> the data better.<p>
4.Model Selection
<p>Choose appropriate machine learning<br> or deep learning models for
 your prediction task.Common choices include regression models, 
 time series models,
 and neural networks.<p>
5.Data Splitting<br>
<p>Split your dataset into training, validation,and test sets.<br> 
 This helps evaluate model performance and prevent<br> overfitting.<p>
6.Model Training: <br>
<p>Train your selected models on the training data. <br>
  Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different algorithm<p>
7.Normalising Data:<br>
  <p>Detecting Date coloumn and normalising using MinMaxScaler<p> 
8.Model Evaluation:<br>
<p>Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics<br> 
 like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 
 Mean Squared Error (MSE), or accuracy, depending on the specific 
 prediction task.<p><br>
