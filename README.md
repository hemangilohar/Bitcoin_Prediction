Bitcoin  Price Prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning
<br>
</h1>Step1: Data Collection</h1>
<p>Loading Dataset from Yahoo Finance<p>
<br>
</h2>Step2: Data Preprocessing<h1>
  <p>Clean and prepare the data. This includes handling missing values,
  outliers and converting data into suitable format for analysis<p>
  <br>
</h1> Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)</h1>
<br>
<p>Conduct exploratory analysis to understand  the data better.<p>
<h1>Model Selection:<h1>
<br>
<p>Choose appropriate machine learning or deep learning models for your prediction task.
  Common choices include regression models, time series models, and neural networks.<p>
<h1>Data Splitting:<h1>
  <br>
<p>Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. 
  This helps evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.<p>
<h1>Model Training:<h1>
  <br>
<p>Train your selected models on the training data. 
  Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different alg<p>
    <br>
    <h1>Normalising Data:<h1>
      <br>
      <p>Detecting Date coloumn and normalising using MinMaxScaler<p>
        <br>
  <h1>Model Evaluation:
    <br>
<p>Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 
  Mean Squared Error (MSE), or accuracy, depending on the specific prediction task.<p>
