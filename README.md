# Bitcoin_Prediction using LSTM
Bitcoin  Price Prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning<br>
1.Data Collection<br>
Loading Dataset from Yahoo Finance<br>
2.Data Preprocessing<br>
  Clean and prepare the data.  This includes handling missing values, outliers 
   and converting data into suitable format  for analysis<br>
3.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)<br>
 Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the data better.<br>
4.Model Selection<br>
 Choose appropriate machine learning or deep learning models for your<br>
 prediction task.<br>
 Common choices include  regression models,time series models,<br>
 and neural networks.<br>
5.Data Splitting<br>
 Split your dataset into training, validation,and test sets.<br>
 This helps evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.<br>
6.Model Training: <br>
  Train your selected models on the training data.<br> 
  Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different algorithm<br>
7.Normalising Data:<br>
  Detecting Date coloumn and normalising using MinMaxScaler<br>
8.Model Evaluation:<br>
  Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics<br>
 like Mean Absolute Error (MAE),  Mean Squared Error (MSE), <br>
 or accuracy, depending on the specific <br>
 prediction task.<br>
