# Bitcoin_Prediction using LSTM
Bitcoin  Price Prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning<br>
1.Data Collection
Loading Dataset from Yahoo Finance
2.Data Preprocessing
  Clean and prepare the data.  This includes handling missing values, outliers 
   and converting data into suitable format  for analysis
3.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
 Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the data better.
4.Model Selection
 Choose appropriate machine learning or deep learning models for your
 prediction task.
 Common choices include  regression models,time series models,
 and neural networks.
5.Data Splitting
 Split your dataset into training, validation,and test sets.
 This helps evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
6.Model Training: 
  Train your selected models on the training data. 
  Adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different algorithm
7.Normalising Data:
  <p>Detecting Date coloumn and normalising using MinMaxScaler 
8.Model Evaluation:
  Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
 like Mean Absolute Error (MAE),  Mean Squared Error (MSE), 
 or accuracy, depending on the specific 
 prediction task.
